The bible parser should start a server up to take the url provided and return json object with all the needed info in it.

It starts with just the JW english bible.
I plan on adding other publications as well as parsing images.

This should also have an embedding toggle, to allow vector embeddings of various models so you can take the output and embed them
in a vector DB.
