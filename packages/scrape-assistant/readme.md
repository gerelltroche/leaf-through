While working on ../bible-parser I wondered how i would know if i extracted all the relevant information for my task.

Since i didn't want to manually review each file, this project arose. It's essentially an llm powered HTML reviewer.

As I parse/scrape, i'll remove the tags i've processed, the left over shell of HTML will be input into this and if there's
anything i missed, it can save it in a folder for me to review.
